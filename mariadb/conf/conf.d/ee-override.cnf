# - Uncontrolled binlog growth can consume excessive disk space
# - Traditional methods (expire_logs_days, max_binlog_size) only limit:
#   * Individual file size OR
#   * Retention period
#   â†’ No total storage cap
#
# binlog_space_limit
# - Mechanism:
#   1. Sets hard limit for ALL binlogs combined (bytes)
#   2. Auto-purges oldest files when limit reached
#   3. Always retains newest logs for recovery/replication

max_binlog_size = 100M    # Max per-file size (avoids oversized files)
binlog_space_limit = 2G   # Total storage cap (self-cleaning mechanism)
